# RootFinder

The goal of this project is to calculate polynomial roots efficiently & precisely. This is achieved through [Homotopy continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_algebraic_geometry#Homotopy_continuation) with [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) applied at each step for course correction.
